**Chapter 1. Graph Machine Learning**
- **1.1. XXX** 
	- XXX [\[lab repo\]](https://github.com/DM2-ND/XXX) [\[src repo\]](https://github.com/)
	  - Paper: *XXX* (XXX 20XX) [\[download\]](https://XXX)
	  - Leading author: XXX (XXX@nd.edu)
	  - Usage: XXX
	  - Novelty: XXX
- **1.2. XXX** 
	- XXX [\[lab repo\]](https://github.com/DM2-ND/XXX) [\[src repo\]](https://github.com/)
	  - Paper: *XXX* (XXX 20XX) [\[download\]](https://XXX)
	  - Leading author: XXX (XXX@nd.edu)
	  - Usage: XXX
	  - Novelty: XXX

**Chapter 2. Information Extraction** 
- **2.1. Scientific Named Entity Recognition (SciNER)** 
	- TriTrain [\[lab repo\]](https://github.com/DM2-ND/TriTrain) [\[src repo\]](https://github.com/QingkaiZeng/TriTrain)
	  - Paper: *Tri-Train: Automatic Pre-Fine Tuning between Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning for SciNER* (EMNLP 2020) [\[download\]](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.429.pdf)
	  - Leading author: Qingkai Zeng (qzeng@nd.edu)
	  - Usage: Given a sentence "FDA has approved remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in certain situations", can we detect "FDA: Organization", "remdesivir: Drug", and "COVID-19: disease"? This framework performs NER in scientific domains.
	  - Novelty: It introduces a "pre-fine tuning" step between pre-training and fine-tuning to fast and effectively adapt NER models in new scientific domains.
- **2.2. XXX** 
	- XXX [\[lab repo\]](https://github.com/DM2-ND/XXX) [\[src repo\]](https://github.com/)
	  - Paper: *XXX* (XXX 20XX) [\[download\]](https://XXX)
	  - Leading author: XXX (XXX@nd.edu)
	  - Usage: XXX
	  - Novelty: XXX

**Chapter 3. Natural Language Generation**
- **3.1. XXX** 
	- XXX [\[lab repo\]](https://github.com/DM2-ND/XXX) [\[src repo\]](https://github.com/)
	  - Paper: *XXX* (XXX 20XX) [\[download\]](https://XXX)
	  - Leading author: XXX (XXX@nd.edu)
	  - Usage: XXX
	  - Novelty: XXX
- **3.2. XXX** 
  - KENLG-Reading [\[lab repo\]](https://github.com/DM2-ND/KENLG-Reading) [\[src repo\]](https://github.com/wyu97/KENLG-Reading)
	  - Paper: *A Survey of Knowledge-enhanced Text Generation* [\[download\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04389)
	  - Leading author: Wenhao Yu (wyu1@nd.edu)
	  - Usage: It offers a long reading list to complement with the survey paper. Related literature in 2020-2021 has been added and discussed.
	  - Novelty: Enhancing natural language generation (NLG) with knowledge is a very popular research direction. However, there was not a comprehensive survey.
